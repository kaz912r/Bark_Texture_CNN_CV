# Bark_Texture_CNN_CV
Fellowship Problem Statement Submission Sept 22

This project is based on kaggle dataset https://streaklinks.com/BN3OC9h9PTELXQiQgQqvAb63/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Fsaurabhshahane%2Fbarkvn50 where i have only used 8 classes just to show how multiclass image classification works using transfer learning via Imagenet algorithms like VGG16 and Xception.
It's majorly built in Tensorflow and image preprocessing was achieved using OpenCV.
